# wanAspects Dual License

wanAspects is offered under a dual-license model so the project can stay open to the community while also supporting proprietary deployments. Instead of embedding each license text directly in this repository, we reference the authoritative sources below.

## Option 1: GNU General Public License v3.0 or later (GPL-3.0-or-later)
- Use, modify, and redistribute wanAspects under the terms of the GNU GPL version 3.0 (or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation).
- Review the full license text directly from the FSF: <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.txt>.
- When selecting this option you must comply with every obligation in the GPL (for example, providing source code for derivative works and preserving copyright notices).

## Option 2: Commercial License
- Organizations that cannot comply with the GPL may obtain a commercial license from the maintainers.
- Commercial terms allow embedding wanAspects in closed-source or proprietary products without the reciprocal obligations of the GPL.
- Request pricing or a signed agreement via <mailto:ealae_ehanu@proton.me>. A dedicated licensing portal will be announced later.

## Contributor License Notice
By contributing to wanAspects, you agree that your contributions may be licensed under both options described above. This ensures the project can continue releasing under GPL-3.0-or-later and the commercial license simultaneously.

If you are unsure which license applies to your intended use, review the linked terms and reach out before distributing a proprietary derivative.
